Clone the project in your local

After cloning, open it on your preferred text editor and set up the ENV. 
Open a console and run the commands `composer install` and `npm install`, once done, run the command `php artisan migrate` and it will migrate the table into your database.
After running the migration, run `npm run dev` or `npm run build` to compile the CSS and JS resources.
